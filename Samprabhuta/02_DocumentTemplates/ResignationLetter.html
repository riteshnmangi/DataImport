<br />
<p>I confirm that, my notice period will start only after I clear all the dues through bank cheque paid toward the
    company <strong>[[CompanyName]]</strong> as account payee only and not through any other medium like cash or in any
    non-monetary
    manner.
</p>
<br />
<p>I confirm that, I will fully co-operate during hand-over process and hand-over techno-functional knowledge, company
    email box, company assets, software access, client document and any other statutory information and document and

<p>If I will stop coming in office without any information during resignation period, then it will be treated as
    absconding and I am aware about legal consequences of the same.
